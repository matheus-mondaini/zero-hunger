This project aims to tackle the issue of hunger and food waste by developing a Food Distribution Management System. The system connects surplus food from farms and leftover food from restaurants to people in need, thereby contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.

## **Problem Statement**

Despite global food production being sufficient to feed the world population, **approximately 795 million people suffer from hunger**, and this number is expected to increase by 2 billion by 2050. The root cause of this paradox lies in the tremendous amount of food waste generated worldwide. **It is estimated that 1.3 billion tons of food**, valued at around US$1 trillion, **goes to waste** annually. 

**This amount of wasted food is more than enough to feed all the people suffering from hunger across the globe**. This highlights the urgency and importance of tackling food waste to combat hunger effectively.

**Global Food Production Efficiency:**

Despite the current global population standing at 7.6 billion, it is important to note that the world's farmers already produce enough food to meet the needs of 1.5 times the global population, which would be sufficient to feed 10 billion people. This signifies the remarkable efficiency of global food production systems. However, it is essential to address the existing challenges in food distribution and waste management to ensure that this abundance of food reaches those in need and contributes to the goal of eliminating hunger.

By highlighting this fact, we recognize that the issue of hunger is not primarily caused by a lack of food production, but rather by obstacles related to distribution, accessibility, and wastage. Therefore, our program aims to bridge this gap by efficiently managing surplus food from farms and restaurants, connecting it with people in need, and contributing to the objective of achieving Goal 2: Zero Hunger of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

It is our belief that by leveraging the existing efficiency of global food production and implementing effective distribution and waste reduction strategies, we can make significant progress in tackling hunger and ensuring food security for all.

## **Solution**

The Food Distribution Management System addresses this problem by connecting surplus food with individuals in need. The system facilitates the collection, categorization, and distribution of food through the following features and functionalities:

1. **Candidate Registration:** Collecting and managing data of individuals interested in receiving food aid. 
2. **Preference Calculation and Approval:** The system calculates the preference and priority of approved candidates based on factors like income, family size, medical needs, dietary restrictions, and availability for food collection. It ensures a fair distribution of surplus food by allocating a percentage of leftovers to each candidate based on their region.
3. Producers **Registration:** Food producers and restaurants can register in the system and provide information such as name, address, and storage capacity. Additionally, they can specify any specific types of leftover food they have available for donation.
4. **Usability of Producers:** Producers can daily update the quantity of leftover food in kilograms, provide the location for food collection, and activate or deactivate their participation in the distribution.
5. **Distribution Process:** The system sends alerts to individuals near the food distribution location, allowing them to accept or decline the offer. If accepted, both the individual and the restaurant receive information about the collection location and the quantity of food.
6. **Additional Features:** The system includes geolocation capabilities to notify nearby individuals about available surplus food automatically. It also incorporates a feedback system for recipients to evaluate the quality and quantity of the received food. Moreover, a reporting system allows users to track the amount of food donated and received over time.
7. **Extended Functionalities:** The system enables the registration of food donors and charitable institutions, facilitating the identification and recording of food donations. It also supports the management of donation information, including food type, quantity, and expiration dates. Search functionalities allow users to find specific donations based on food type or expiration date. Additionally, the system generates reports on donations made, facilitating monitoring and evaluation of the initiative's impact.

## **Benefits**

The Food Distribution Management System offers several benefits:

- Reduces food waste by connecting surplus food from farms and restaurants to individuals in need.
- Ensures a fair distribution of surplus food based on candidates' needs, income, family size, and dietary restrictions.
- Encourages volunteer participation through a scoring system that rewards individuals who help collect and distribute food.
- Provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing food donations and tracking their impact.
- Raises awareness about food waste and promotes a change in consumer attitudes towards responsible food consumption.

## **Goals**

The goals of the Food Distribution Management System are as follows:

1. Minimize food waste and maximize food utilization.
2. Ensure equitable distribution of surplus food based on candidates' needs.
3. Promote volunteerism and community engagement.
4. Raise awareness about responsible food consumption.
5. Contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.
